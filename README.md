# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a python version of a Tic Tac Toe game 
It is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players
